# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis was to find the number of rides, drivers, and fares characterized by rural, urban, or suburban city type. This was then used to calculate the average fare per ride and average fare per driver. Finally, to display these findings, a line graph of the trends of each city type was created to show the total fare of each week from January to April. 

## Results: 
The analysis began with creating a dataframe that displayed the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver. Looking at this data, the majority of drivers are urban and the least amount of drivers are rural. The other columns of data are proportional to this information as the rural area has the least amount of rides and fares. This makes the average of fares per ride and driver the highest. It can be concluded that the fare is higher than that of suburban or urban area per ride and therefore each driver as well. On the other end, urban has the most drivers and therefore the most rides and the highest total fares. However, the average per ride and driver is the least out of the three. Therefore, each ride is cheaper compared to the rural and suburban areas.

Now looking at the line graph, the total fare was calculated for each week beginning in January. This graph shows that the total fare is consistent within each city type as the respective lines stay within a certain range. The yellow line which represents the urban data and shows that the total fare each week for the area is always higher than the rural and suburban areas. Therefore, the urban area produces the most fare money but because most drivers are in that area, the average is lower when compared to the urban and rural areas.

## Summary: 
The two extreme areas are the urban and rural areas with the urban areas having the most drivers but the average fare per driver is the least and the rural areas have the least drivers but the highest average fare per driver. 
 
The urban area brings in the most fares, however the drivers are not getting the most money on average. A suggestion could be to raise the prices as the urban city has the lowest average fare per ride. There is clearly a demand for rides since the area has the most rides, therefore charging more can increase the average fare per driver.

Another suggestion would be to increase intiative for more drivers in rural areas. Rural areas currently have the least amount of drivers and therefore also have the least total fare amount. Therefore, as the number of rural drivers increase, the total fare will increase and therefore the average fare per driver would decrease and that would close the extreme disparity between the range for the average fare per driver.

Lastly, the data for the suburban area seems to be in closer proximity to the rural areas as opposed to the urban area. It could possibly be because a rural area has similar characteristics to a rural area that relate to the use of a ride service. Therefore, a suggestion would be to also increase the number of drivers in the suburban area in order to close the gap between the urban and suburban areas. This could be done by increasing the intiative of using Pyber by either lowering the cost of each ride or creating more drivers in order to make the service more convenient.
